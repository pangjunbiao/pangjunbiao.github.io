## ABOUT ME 

I am currently an associate Professor at Beijing University of Technology and a Ph.D. supervisor. I am a researcher of Beijing Key Laboratory, a senior member of CCF, and a member of CCF Multimedia Specialized Committee. I received Ph.D. from Prof. Qingming Huang and co-founded with him the Social Multimedia Data Analysis Group at BIT. With the support of a number of national, provincial and municipal projects, I have conducted research on image and video understanding, intelligent human-computer interaction, cross-media analysis and reasoning, and intelligent transportation. I have published more than 60 papers in IEEE/ACM journals and top academic conferences. I preside over the research projects of National Foundation, Military Science and Technology Commission, and participate in the key projects of National Foundation, 973 projects, 863 projects and other projects. I designed and developed a deep learning based structural parsing system for telecommunication drawings to support China Unicom to build a digital twin system for rapid semanticization of a large number of telecommunication drawings, designed and developed a vehicle parking behavior parsing module for on-street vehicle parking in Beijing to support the implementation of a large-scale on-street automated parking charging system in Beijing.
